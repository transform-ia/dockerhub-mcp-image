# Contributing to Docker Hub MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Docker Hub Model Context Protocol (MCP) server!
This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Types of Contributions

### 1. New Tools

The repository contains reference tools, please try to keep consistency as much as possible.

- Check the [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) documentation
- Ensure your tool doesn't duplicate existing functionality
- Consider whether your tool would be generally useful to others
- Follow
  [security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#security-considerations)
  from the MCP documentation
- Ensure the [MCP sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) does not already
  provide helpers/functions before creating custom code.
- Update [README.md](./README.md) with instructions and examples.

### 2. Improvements to Existing Tools

Enhancements to existing tools are welcome! This includes:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- New features/parameters
- Security enhancements

### 3. Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fixing typos or unclear instructions
- Adding examples
- Improving setup instructions
- Adding troubleshooting guides

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dockerhub-mcp.git
    ```

3. Add the upstream remote:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/docker/hub-mcp.git
    ```

4. Create a branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```

## Development Guidelines

This section gives the experienced contributor some tips and guidelines.

### Pull requests are always welcome

Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix it? Do it! We will
appreciate it. Any significant change, like adding a backend, should be documented as
[a GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/hub-mcp/issues) before anybody starts working on it.

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests. We do our best to process them quickly. If your
pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't get discouraged!

### Talking to other Docker users and contributors

| Channel | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Community Slack | The Docker Community has a dedicated Slack chat to discuss features and issues. You can sign-up at <https://www.docker.com/community/>. |
| Forums | A public forum for users to discuss questions and explore current design patterns and best practices about Docker and related projects in the Docker Ecosystem. To participate, just log in with your Docker Hub account on <https://forums.docker.com>. |
| Twitter | You can follow [Docker's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/docker/) to get updates on our products. You can also tweet us questions or just share blogs or stories. |
| Stack Overflow | Stack Overflow has over 17000 Docker questions listed. We regularly monitor [Docker questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker) and so do many other knowledgeable Docker users. |

### Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bug fix branch, name it XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the issue.
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your intentions, and name it
  XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the issue.

Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance.
Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run format:fix` before committing your changes. Most editors have
plug-ins helping reducing the time spent on fixing linting issues.

Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues
that they address.

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the
imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the
summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the suggested
modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Post a comment after pushing. New
commits show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers are notified only when you
comment.

Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of the base branch without multiple branches mixed into
the PR.

**Git tip**: If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use `rebase main` in your feature branch to update
your pull request rather than `merge main`.

Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work using `git rebase -i`
and `git push -f`. A logical unit of work is a consistent set of patches that should be reviewed
together: for example, upgrading the version of a vendored dependency and taking advantage of its
now available new feature constitute two separate units of work. Implementing a new function and
calling it in another file constitute a single logical unit of work. The very high majority of
submissions should have a single commit, so if in doubt: squash down to one.

After every commit, make sure to test tools behavior. Include documentation changes in the same pull
request so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

Include an issue reference like `Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX` in the pull request description that
closes an issue. Including references automatically closes the issue on a merge.

Please see the [Code Style](#code-style) for further guidelines.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies
that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The
rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from
[developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```text
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically
with `git commit -s`.

## Docker community guidelines

We want to keep the Docker community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep
it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a
whole:

- Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial,
  gender or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!

- Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of
  their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage
  participation in our community.

- Keep it legal: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share
  private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.

- Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic
  discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending
  it to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also, remember that nobody
  likes spam.

- Don't send emails to the maintainers: There's no need to send emails to the maintainers to ask
  them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a pull request. Instead of sending an email,
  GitHub mentions should be used to ping maintainers to review a pull request, a proposal or an
  issue.

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the repository
- Include appropriate type definitions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Make sure to run linting (`npm run lint`)

### Documentation

- Document all configuration options if required
- Provide setup instructions if required
- Include usage examples

### Security

- Follow security best practices
- Implement proper input validation
- Handle errors appropriately
